# Predicting Solubility of Chemical Compounds

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to predict the solubility of chemical compounds based on their molecular descriptors. Solubility is an important property in drug development and chemical engineering, and accurate prediction models can assist in the design of new compounds.

## Project Description:
This project involves the use of machine learning techniques to predict the solubility of various chemical compounds. The dataset contains molecular descriptors, which are used as input features to train the model. The project explores different models and evaluates their performance to identify the most accurate predictor.

## Key Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning.
Feature selection based on molecular descriptors.
Implementation of multiple machine learning models.
Model evaluation using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².
Visualization of results and model comparisons.

### Tools & Libraries:

Python,
Scikit-learn,
Pandas,
Matplotlib,
NumPy

## Usage:
This project is useful for researchers and practitioners in the fields of chemistry and pharmaceutical sciences who are interested in predicting the solubility of new compounds.
